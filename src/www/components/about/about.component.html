    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Datarea.io</strong> is a search engine that allows you to search
      data across open data portals at multiple networks.
    </p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>T
      he number of open data portals and open data has been dramatically
      increasing in the recent years. With the advancing regulation and
      technology, more individuals and organizations are joining the force of
      data opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are excited, but yet concerned, to see this future.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://opendatainception.io/" target="_blank">recent survey</a>
      shows that there are more than 2,600 data portals around the world. Most
      data portals are either disconnected to each other, or only within a
      local network run by a portal service provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      It needs time, experience, and even connections for the data user to
      identify the correct data portal and find the correct data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be simpler.
    </p>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Datarea.io</strong> provides the one-click-and-search-all service.
    </p>
    <p>
      By collecting open data metadata from more than 700 portals in different
      open data networks, we are able to build one open data network that
      includes the majority of the world of open data and just search in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You only need to type your keywords in one text box and
      <strong>Datarea.io</strong> will present you the correct dataset from
      the correct portal.
