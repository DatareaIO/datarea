    What is Singular Data Net?
  </h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Singular Data Net</strong> is an experimental project to provide one
    single search box for datasets from multiple data providers. With a data
    engine that constantly monitor the update of data providers, we are able to
    build a unified search index with standarized open data metadata. The user
    is able to search data from all supported data providers at one click and
    see results in one format.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, the project supports a variety of open data platforms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://hub.arcgis.com/pages/open-data" target="_blank">ArcGIS Open Data</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://ckan.org/" target="_blank">CKAN</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://getdkan.org/" target="_blank">DKAN</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://geonode.org/" target="_blank">GeoNode</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://junar.com/" target="_blank">Junar</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://socrata.com/" target="_blank">Socrata</a></li>
  </ul>

    A full list of supported open data portals (100+) could be found

  <h1>
    Why is it developed?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Open data is not open if it cannot be discovered by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every data analyst has experienced the pain of finding the correct open data.
    Though open data is becoming a popular concept and more action is being taken,
    the discovery of data doesn't seem as easy as it looks like. Of many factors
    that contributes to this problems, there are two significant factors:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open data is a highly popular field that attracts many governments and
      organizations to participate. The increasing number of data providers
      also increases the difficulty for a user to identify the source of a
      particular dataset.
    </li>
    <li>
      Since it is still an reapidly developing area, many different standards
      and practices co-exist. The various ways to search and present data result
      in confusion and therefore makes the data discovery again uneasy.
    </li>
  </ul>

    How does it work?

    What is the current state?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Since my participation into the team behind ArcGIS Open Data, I
    have been focusing on developing ArcGIS Open Data to be a superior data
    discovery platform for uers. This project will be alive as a place to
    collect data and experienment open data ideas after work, but less activity
    may be expected.
